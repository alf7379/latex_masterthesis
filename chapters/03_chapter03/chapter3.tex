\chapter{Benchmark Methods}\label{ord:ch3}

In this chapter the interactive methods used in the benchmark study are introduced.
Their technical functionality is explained in detail, while the motivation behind their selection is discussed in Section \ref{ord:ch4:sec2}.

The following methods are used to perform class-agnostic segmentation, thereby a foreground object is separated from the background without predicting the class of the foreground object.
The setup is the following: An image, that contains one or multiple objects, is shown to the user and the user's task is to create separate masks for the objects in the image.
To segment multiple objects in one image, the method has to be applied for each object separately.
The images are usually colored and consists of the three \gls{rgb} color channels.
