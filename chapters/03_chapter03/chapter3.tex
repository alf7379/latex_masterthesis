\chapter{Benchmark Methods}\label{ord:ch3}

In this chapter the interactive methods used in the Benchmark are introduced.
Their technical functionality is explained in detail, while the motivation behind their selection is discussed in Section \ref{ord:ch4:sec3}.

The following methods all perform in the same setup: An image, that contains one or multiple objects, is shown to the user and the user's task is to create separate masks for the objects in the image.
To segment multiple objects in one image, the method has to be applied for each object separately.
The image is usually colored and contains the three \gls{rgb} channels.
%TODO what about gray scale images
%TODO class-agnostic image segmentation
