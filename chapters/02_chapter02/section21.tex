\section{ML, DL and CNN}\label{ord:ch2:sec1}

%The last decade was revolutionary for the sector of information technology.
%Due to technical advancement, the computational power of processors, especially \gls{gpu} rise significantly.
%Further, the wider creation and use of data introduced the domain of big data, that allows operators to gain more insights and benefits.
%Both of these recent advancements benefited another field of study commonly described as \gls{ai}.
%The term \gls{ai} describes machines that are show characteristics of human intelligence that allow them to handle various tasks.
%But there are several gradations, that hide behind the powerful bus word \gls{ai} and are illustrated in this section.

\subsection{Machine Learning}\label{ord:ch2:sec1:subsec1}

%\gls{ml} is a subsection of \gls{ai} and is based on the ability of algorithms to analyze, detect and learn patterns in various kinds of data. 
%Applying these learned pattern \gls{ml} algorithms may reach human level performance or even better, but they are limited specifically to their scope.
%For other tasks mostly a new \gls{ml} algorithms needs to be defined

%In contrast \gls{ai} may be able to solve various tasks and learn independently by showing strong characteristics of human intelligence.
