\section{Generalization over users}\label{ord:ch5:sec_3_generalization_user}

% RE-1468
A challenge for all studies with user interaction are the users themselves, because users have different levels often knowledge and therefore, can be biased.
This also applied to the application of the same methods by different users.
% Unteschiede bei verschiedenen Usern sind nicht vermeidbar -> unterschieldiches Level an Erfahrung, unters. Motivation bzw. Verständnis für Genauigkeit und 'wann man fertig ist'.
In this study, participants are biased by different levels of experience, understanding of accuracy, professional background, and motivation.

% Ziel = Methode zu finden mit der alles User gut klarkommen und die über verschiedene user gute Resultate in Zeit und IoU erziehlt.
In order to find wide application, an interactive method must work consistently even with diverse users.
This section examines the generalization capabilities of the benchmark methods across different users and therefore, is the counterpart to the previous section.
% Motivation: generalization over user -> an interactive method really performs well and reliable if it delivers good results for all possible users.




\subsection{Benchmark Participants Evaluation}\label{ord:ch5:sec3:subsec1}

In the following the performance of the methods is evaluated over the \getNumberBenchmarkParticipants participants.
In contrast to the previous evaluation, here the benchmark runs performed by the colleagues, who are working on this topic, are excluded.
This is done intentionally, in order to not distort the evaluation, since the users are explicitly evaluated here and these users would be strongly biased due to their experience.

In order to evaluate the generalization capabilities across multiple users, first statistical key figures as the mean and standard deviation $ \sigma $ are evaluated.
The combined mean and $ \sigma $ for the participants are presented in Table \ref{tab:ch5:all_benchmark_users_varaince}.
% For IoU low std-dev, but for time vergleichsweise hoch 
It can be observed, that $ \sigma_{IoU} $ is very similar for the benchmark methods and only ranges from $ \sigma_{IoU} = 0.1187 $ for \gls{dextr} to $ \sigma_{IoU} = 0.1669 $ for watershed.
In the opposite $ \sigma_{time} $ shows a strong deviation, with $ \sigma_{time} = 15.0977 $ for \gls{dextr} the deviation is more than double than $ \sigma_{time} = 39.0214 $ for polygon.
The mean value is presented to put $ \sigma $ into context.
A graphical illustration if the deviation of $ IoU $ and $ time $ is already presented in the box plots from Figure \ref{fig:ch5:sec1:iou_box_plot} and \ref{fig:ch5:sec1:time_box_plot}.
Further, these results support the conclusion of Subsection \ref{ord:ch5:sec1:subsec2} and \ref{ord:ch5:sec1:subsec3}, which state that in terms of $ IoU $ the \gls{dextr} method performs best, while $ \overline{time} $ and $ med(time) $ do differ significantly between the \gls{dl} based and classical benchmark methods.

\end{table}

To get even deeper insights about the generalization across different users, in Figure \ref{fig:ch5:sec3:all_benchmark} box plots for $ IoU $ and $ time $ are shown for all participants individually.
Here, no statistical tests for equality within the methods were performed, because the visualization already anticipates that there are strong deviations between the user for each method.
The variations between the individual users are present in all methods and most likely due to the user's bias as introduced in the beginning of this section.
% \eg different experience levels, how , and how well a user got along with the method.

However, it can be stated that for $IoU$ the \gls{dextr} has the smallest deviation and is the most constant method over all participants, while the other methods still perform similar.

\end{figure}

In terms of $ time $ the \gls{dl} based methods show less variance over the users than the classical methods.
The \gls{dextr} method performs best, while the \gls{iog} method has two bigger outliers.
The difference between \gls{dl} based and classical methods is partly caused by the design of the methods, which guides the user more or less.
On the one side, the polygon and watershed method do little to guide the user,
but give the user a lot of freedom when performing the label task.
This room for interpretation is used differently by the users, which leads to different label times and therefore higher variance.
On the other side, the \gls{dextr} and \gls{iog} method provide strong guidance by defining the amount of clicks required for an initial prediction.
Although the application of refinement is still possible, this prevents users from spending too much time on an initial prediction.
This strong guidance of the user while applying the method leads to a more constant annotation time and thereby a lower variance in $ time $.
% polygon and watershed are more freely

In conclusion, for $IoU$ the \gls{dextr} method generalizes best over multiple users, while the other models do no achieve a constant performance over various users.
For $ time $ it is observed, that methods with strong guidance as \gls{dextr} and \gls{iog} are more constant in $ time $, than the polygon and watershed method, that are designed more open and therefore allow higher variance.


\subsection{Two Experienced Users} \label{ord:ch5:sec3:subsec2_cmo_afe}

Normally, the participants have labeled only a part of the benchmark images. 
In the following, eight benchmark runs are evaluated where all benchmark images were labeled by two users who have more experience by working on this topic.
Although only two different users are compared with each other, the significance is given, since all images of the benchmark were labeled.
However, it must be mentioned that the experience level of both users is not the same, because $ \textnormal{\textit{User 2}} $ is more trained than $ \textnormal{\textit{User 1}} $.

% No significant difference in the IoU between the two user could be detected -> generalize well over various users (few user, large data)
For the $ IoU $ the box plots in Figure \ref{fig:ch5:sec3:cmo_afe_iou} indicates, that the $ IoU $ is more or less equal over $ \textnormal{\textit{User 1}} $ and $ \textnormal{\textit{User 2}} $ for the four benchmark methods.
The equality of the obtained values from both users are statistically confirmed by the Kruskal-Wallis test, the details of the tests are presented in Table \ref{tab:appendix:afe_cmo_kruskal_wallis_iou}.

An equivalent analysis was performed for $ time $, as presented in Figure \ref{fig:ch5:sec3:cmo_afe_time}.
Interestingly here the annotation time between $ \textnormal{\textit{User 1}} $ and $ \textnormal{\textit{User 2}} $ differs strongly for polygon and watershed, while the annotation time is very similar for \gls{dextr} and \gls{iog}.
The statistical relevance of this observation is again confirmed by the Kruskal-Wallis test, presented in detail in Table \ref{tab:appendix:afe_cmo_kruskal_wallis_time}.

 	\end{subfigure}
 	\caption[Box plots of two experienced user on $ IoU $ and $ time$.]{		
 		These two figures show the comparison of the two users over the several benchmark methods based on $ IoU $ and $ time $.
 		The hypothesis based on the graphical visualizations are statistically supported by the Kruskal-Wallis test as presented in detail in Table \ref{tab:appendix:afe_cmo_kruskal_wallis_iou} and \ref{tab:appendix:afe_cmo_kruskal_wallis_time}.

\end{figure}

% User 2 more experienced that User 1
This large difference for Polygon and Watershed was not expected, but it emphasizes again how large the variance can be between different users who achieve the same performance.
This difference may be partly caused by the different level of experience of the two users.
Anyway, it is not surprising that this occurs for the classical methods, that are more freely interpretable and therefore, leave the user a more open application.
Rather this supports the conclusion of the previous subsection, that methods with stronger guidance perform more consistent in the annotation time.


\subsection{Simulations With Different Click Patterns}\label{ord:ch5:sec3:subsec3}
% RE-1468

% Simulations are easily scalable, faster and cheaper than the acquisition of manual clicks from real users.
% Second, in a simulation no variance occurs between the set clicks of various users, if the .
% Third, simulations have the possibility to effortless create various click patterns, that \eg vary the set click by a random offset, in order to simulate a various types of user behavior.
%On the other hand, simulations are only capable to replicate the user's behavior to a certain extent.
% Further, the involvement of human users is especially important for methods, which performance depends on user interactions.


In order to gain deeper insights on the functionality of the \gls{dextr} and \gls{iog} method the simulation setup is modified.
% Motivation - Nachahmung von unterschiedlichen Usertypen durch unterschiedliche Genauigkeit bei der Klick-Simulation.
The altered simulation setup uses different levels of accuracy, to simulate more realistic user clicks.
% Simulation of with different permutation / deviation / - simulation of different user

The level of accuracy is defined by a deviation of maximal $ n_{deviation} $ \Unit{px}.
In the range $ \left[-n_{deviation}, \dots, 0, \dots, n_{deviation} \right] $ two values are randomly selected and added to the ideal row and column.
This random factor was added, to simulate the varying accuracy of single user clicks.
The smaller $ n_{deviation} $, the more accurate are the simulated clicks.
In the simulation first the ideal click position is calculated and further the random deviation is added.
This procedure is applied to the extreme points of the \gls{dextr} method and to the fore- and background clicks of the \gls{iog} method.

	}\label{tab:ch5:simulation_various_click_patterns}
\end{table}

The performance constantly decreases with higher $ n_{deviation} $, as demonstrated in Table \ref{tab:ch5:simulation_various_click_patterns}. 
Even a comparable small deviation of maximal 5 \Unit{px} leads a notable drop in performance \eg from $ mIoU = 0.9103 $ to 0.8323 for \gls{iog} on the PASCAL \gls{voc} dataset with the application of \gls{vp}.
This factor needs to be taken into account, if these methods are applied by real users.
