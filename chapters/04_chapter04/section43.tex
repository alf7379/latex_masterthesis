\section{Benchmark Statistics}\label{ord:ch4:sec3}

In the scope of the benchmark study several statistics were recorded and measured, that may be grouped in three parts: segmentation result, user interactions and, user survey.

% #1 Performance IoU
First, the saved segmentation results are used to calculate the \gls{iou} as measure of performance for each user created annotation.

% #2 User interactions.
Second, the user interactions were recorded, that are required to perform the interactive methods.
% TODO what about usability??
% Based on these statistics the usability of the labeling process is evaluated.
These statistics on the user interactions exist for every annotation, the most important are presented in the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Used method}, the interactive method used to create the annotation.
	\item \textbf{Annotation time}, the time spent to create the annotation.
	\item \textbf{Number of clicks}, the number of clicks used.
	\item \textbf{Number of strokes}, the amount of strokes drawn for the annotation.
	\item \textbf{Stroke time}, the time spent on each stroke, in order to differentiate between short and long strokes.
	\item \textbf{Number of foreground clicks}, the amount of clicks on the foreground.
	\item \textbf{Number of background clicks}, the amount of clicks on the background.

% #3 Survey to get an idea about the soft factors.
Third, the participants filled out a survey, after completing the benchmark study.
This survey enables an insight on the usability of the methods, that are not measurable.
