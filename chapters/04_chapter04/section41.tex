\section{Benchmark Motivation}\label{ord:ch4:sec1}

% Motivation - title and research question
This benchmark study is motivated by two main causes: to evaluate real users and to use a diverse dataset.
Both target the evaluation of the generalization capabilities over different image domains and users.

First, the current evaluations of interactive methods feature the major drawback of using simulations.
The user input is created by simulations, instead of real users, as discussed in Section \ref{ord:ch2:sec3:subsec2}.
This measure seems reasonable with the amount of samples in test or validations sets used in the context of \gls{dl}.
However, these evaluations based on simulations are only meaningful to a limited extent, since a fundamental element, the user interaction, is not taken into account realistically.
In simulations often an almost perfect user is simulated, that makes only few or none mistakes without any inaccuracies, which does not reflect reality.
In contrast, this benchmark study analyses the result of real participants, in order to obtain realistic insights on the performance and usability of the methods.
Thereby, a focus of interest are the generalization capabilities of the methods over different domains and users. 
For this the user interactions are recorded as described in Section \ref{ord:ch4:sec3}.

% Motivation Dataset
Second, the information value of an evaluation strongly depends on the used dataset.
The use of an inappropriate dataset may reduce the validity of the evaluation results.
To objectively evaluate the generalization capability of the interactive methods, a suitable dataset must be used, which should have a high variance in its samples.
In the context of an image dataset this may be achieved by images with diverse domains and attributes.
Therefore, for the scope of this benchmark study a hand chosen dataset was created, which is further described in Section \ref{ord:ch4:sec4}.
