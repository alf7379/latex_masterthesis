\section{Method Selection}\label{ord:ch4:sec2}

The benchmark study includes four methods to interactively create segmentation masks, as introduced in Chapter \ref{ord:ch3}. 
In the following their selection is reasoned.

Polygon drawing does not contain any smart algorithms, but just processes the user input.
This method is included, in order to establish a baseline, that realistically represents manual labeling.
Watershed transformation is included to represent the segmentation algorithms based on classical image processing.
With \gls{iog} and \gls{dextr} two \gls{dl} methods are part of the benchmark study, that represent the current state-of-the-art approaches.
Based on the comparison from Table \ref{tab:ch2:interactive-stae-of-the-art}, the \gls{iog} method performs best, by processing user clicks on fore- and background.
While the \gls{dextr} method only processed user clicks on the boundary of the object.

In order to keep the scope of this thesis feasible, the benchmark study contains these four interactive segmentation methods.
