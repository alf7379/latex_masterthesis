\chapter{Benchmark Setup}\label{ord:ch4}

% TODO define the concept of the benchmark once in the introduction (detailed) and abstract (briefly).

% Basic Idea what is the benchmark about 
The established benchmark study is the centerpiece of this thesis and serves as main instrument to obtain insights about interactive segmentation methods.
In this study real participants apply the interactive methods introduced in Chapter \ref{ord:ch3}, in order to segment objects in various images.
The participating users are mostly employees of the company MVTec Software GmbH, located in Munich.
Within this benchmark study the user interactions and the segmentation results are recorded and saved.
% TODO get number of user and number of annotations.
In total, XXX individuals participated and XXX annotations were obtained.
Based on them a detailed evaluation on the generalization capabilities of the methods is described in Chapter \ref{ord:ch5}.

% real user label 
% Within the scope of this thesis also simulations are performed to evaluate interactive methods (see Chapter XXX).
% Besides the application with real users also simulations are performed and used for evaluation, but they are not in the scope / part of the benchmakr)
