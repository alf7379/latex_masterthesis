\chapter{Benchmark Setup}\label{ord:ch4}

% TODO define the concept of the benchmark once in the introduction (detailed) and abstract (briefly).

% Basic Idea what is the benchmark about 
The established benchmark study is the centerpiece of this thesis and serves as main instrument to obtain insights about interactive segmentation methods.
In this study real participants apply the interactive methods introduced in Chapter \ref{ord:ch3}, in order to segment objects in various images.
The participating users are mostly employees of the company MVTec Software GmbH, located in Munich.
The participants have different levels of experience with labeling
Within this benchmark study the user interactions and the segmentation results are recorded and saved.

In total, \getNumberBenchmarkRuns \space runs of the benchmark study were performed, whereby \getNumberBenchmarkParticipants \space were completely unbiased participants and the remaining benchmark runs were performed by colleagues working on this topic.
A total of \getNumberBenchmarkAnnotations \space annotations were obtained.
Based on these observations the generalization capabilities of the methods are evaluated in Chapter \ref{ord:ch5}.
% real user label 
% Besides the application with real users also simulations are performed and used for evaluation, but they are not in the scope / part of the benchmakr)
